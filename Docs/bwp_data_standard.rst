BWP Data Standard Extension
===========================

The Barcode of Wildlife Data Standard Extension was created by the BWP Specimen Informatics Working Group to hold the barcode records from BWP to the higher level required for using as evidence in court cases.

Relation to Barcode Data Standard
---------------------------------

The first component of the BWP Data Standard states that all "strongly recommended" elements from the Barcode Data Standard are now required. These elements include:
	
	* latitude/longitude
	* name of identifier
	* name of collector
	* collection date
	* PCR primer names

New fields in the BWP Structured Comment
----------------------------------------

In addition to the newly required fields listed above, BWP worked with GenBank to create a standardized BWP "structured comment", which will contatin these extra fields in BWP Barcode GenBank records.
