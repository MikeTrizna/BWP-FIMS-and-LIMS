GenBank Upload
==============

Installing the Geneious Plug-in
-------------------------------
We will be using Geneious's GenBank Submission plug-in to submit completed sequences to GenBank. The Geneious GenBank Submission Plug-in does all of the hard work of bundling together the various parts of a GenBank submission -- sequence data, specimen metadata, trace files, etc.

The easiest way to install the plug-in is within Geneious. Go to Tools > Plugins. In the top "Available Plugins" section, you should see "GenBank Submission" as one of the featured plugins (that's why there is a star next to it).

Click "Install", and Geneious will start downloading it from the Internet. If all goes well, you should see a message telling you that installation was successful, and that a restart will be needed. Restart Geneious.

Using the Plug-in
-----------------
Because traces are a required part of a BARCODE keyword record on GenBank, **use the Assembly as the basis of GenBank submission.**

Organize the assemblies you want to submit, and then go to Tools > Submit to GenBank. Make sure to only select assemblies from one gene at a time. For example, you will have to make a separate submission package for rbcL and matK sequences.

You will see a window appear that has the following sections. Each section is detailed below.

Submission Details
------------------
The first part of the GenBank submission deals with filling out the contact details and attributions for your sequence submission, as well as choosing how to submit to GenBank. Give the "Submission Name" field a descriptive name for your submission. This entry will not show up in the GenBank record. Also, be sure to select the option of "Save a local file (.tar)".

Click on the "Edit Publisher Detailsâ€¦" button to bring up the Publisher Details dialog box.

Contact Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fill out the top section with the contact information for your submission. This will be the information that GenBank staff will use to contact the submitter with questions or updates for the submission.

Affiliation
~~~~~~~~~~~

Fill out the relevant information for the institution that produced these sequences. The entries in this section will show up in the GenBank record, so be sure to provide accurate and consistent information.

Sequence Authors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

List as many people who were involved in the production of these sequences as you can think of. Keep in mind that only these people will be authorized to make changes to the GenBank record.

Consortium
~~~~~~~~~~

Always fill this in as "Barcode of Wildlife Project". This will allow for easier searching and filtering of all BWP-generated sequences.

Publication Status and Title
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We will be generating several different scientific publications about the sequences generated from the Barcode of Wildlife Project, but for now select "Unpublished" for the Publication Status, and "Barcode of Wildlife Project [country]" (where [country] is the name of the BWP partner country that produced the sequence.) Again, this allows for easier searching and filtering, and we will be able to add publications to sequences as they are published.

  This portion of a sample GenBank record shows how the different parts of the Publisher Details section will appear when the record is published.

Field Mapping
-------------
The next part of the GenBank submission, will be to map all of the different specimen metadata fields to your GenBank record.

BWP Structured Comments

Consensus and Primers
---------------------
Since we are submitting from an assembly of traces, we need to specify to Geneious how to calculate the sequence to submit to GenBank. Keep the default settings.

PCR Primers are a required component of the Barcode Data Standard. You will need to tell Geneious which of your fields holds the PCR primer names, and PCR primer sequences.
